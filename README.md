# Digital Clock using Python and Tkinter

## Overview

This project creates a digital clock using Python's Tkinter library. The Tkinter library is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python, and this project demonstrates its use by displaying a real-time digital clock in a window.

## Features

- Displays current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates every second to show the current time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

## Installation

1. *Ensure Python is installed*:
   - Download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

2. *Verify Tkinter installation*:
   - Tkinter typically comes with Python. You can verify its presence by running:
     bash
     python -m tkinter
     
     If a window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

3. *Clone the repository*:
   - Use the following command to clone the repository:
     bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-clock-tkinter.git
     
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     bash
     cd digital-clock-tkinter
     

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   bash
   python digital_clock.py
   
2. A window will open displaying the digital clocks




## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the font, bg, and fg parameters in the clock_label widget. Change the colors, fonts, and sizes to create a different look for the clock.
